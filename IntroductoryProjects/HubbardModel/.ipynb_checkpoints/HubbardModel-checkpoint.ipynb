    "1. Write down the state for a 4 site Hubbard model with the last three sites occupied with alpha electrons. Write down the state for a 4 site Hubbard model with the site 1 and 3 occupied by both alpha and beta electrons.\n",
    "1. What is the maximum number of electrons that can fit in a Hubbard model with 16 sites?\n",
    "1. How many states you can write with three alpha electrons in 16 sites? (hint, remember that electrons are indistinguishable). How many states you can write with two alpha and two beta electrons in 16 sites?\n",
    "1. How is the Hubbard model related to the process of single bond breaking?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coding\n",
    "1. Write a Python function that enumerates all the states with a given number of alpha electrons ($n_\\uparrow$) and beta electrons ($n_\\downarrow$). In your code use a zero-based notation, where each lattice site $i$ is mapped to $i-1$ (so that the lattice indices run from $0$ to $N-1$ included). Extend your code to return the states, representing each state as a list of integers of size $2N$. Can you think of ways you could store this information that is more efficient in terms of computer memory?\n",
    "1. (Optional) Write a function that will print a state in a nice format, for example by indicating an empty site with a `-`, a site occupied by an alpha electron with `↑`, a site occupied by a beta electron with `↓`, and a site occupied by both an alpha and a beta electron with `⇵`.\n",
    "1. (Optional but recommended) Write a Python class that represents the electron configurations as a list of `0`'s and `1`'s."
